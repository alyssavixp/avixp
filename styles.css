/*
oh! funny to run into you here...

feel free to take and iterate on this layout however you like.
if you do, please credit to me if you can, give me a follow, or give this a like as i am building my portfolio :)

about this website design:
this website is based on my nostalgia for being a teenager in the early 2000s and what my desktop looked like 
since my family's computer was a shared device in the living room, and we never changed the wallpaper.
i spent hours on that computer teaching myself html and css to be able to customize my myspace page.
i started teaching myself by inspecting other people's myspace profiles and stealing their code (sorry yall!) 
and messing around with the stylization, making myself familiar to that and other markup languages.
 
i remember daydreaming of the day i got my first computer so i could finally change the background to be something of my own.
27 years later, i still keep Bliss as my background on all my devices.
it brings me back to a time where i was inspired by all the endless possibilities that opened up to me from that very large and very beige computer.
27 years later, i am still inspired by all that the computer (& the internet!) brings me.
